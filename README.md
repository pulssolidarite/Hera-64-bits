## Install Mono for EMV's exectuable

The EMV binary can be found in the Payter repository under releases as a zip file.

Install mono-xsp4 : https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin-ubuntu

If for some obscure reason you need to recompile the Payter project, here is how is done using mono-complete:
`git clone https://github.com/pulssolidarite/PayterPay.git`

Go to PayterPay repository and compile:

`msbuild /p:Configuration=Release`

Move PayterPay/bin/Release/ to home/ and rename it Payter/

## PULS-ARCADE.AppImage

Add these two lines at the end of `/etc/environment` :

> Warning : Make sure to create a new terminal (and activate it) in the Admin Panel and use the logins for following step.

`export PULS_LOGIN=???`

`export PULS_MDP=???`

> Add this for free mode:

`export PULS_SKIPPAYMENT=TRUE`

Download latest AppImage release of Hera and place it in home directory. Grant permissions.

`$ chmod a+x PULS-ARCADE.AppImage`

Test the GUI

`$ ./PULS-ARCADE.AppImage`

> Tip : If the first screen stays white, restart the AppImage.

## Autostart AppImage 

Use the meta screen of Ubuntu to find the "application" manager and add a application to the board.
Write "~/PULS-ARCADE.AppImage" in the Command field and save with a name like "Puls-Arcade".
On next boot Hera will auto start.

## Local Net & Internet

On the AsRock barebone there are two ethernet plugs allowing for a shared connection for the payment terminal and the second can be used as internet acces for when someone changes connection type (wifi/etheret).
This configuration is done in the internet settings, where you can set eth0 to be shared with other computers. This interface now can be plugged to the local network inside the arcade and be used as a internet sharing.

## Enjoy!
